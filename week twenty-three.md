1. Explain API using a restaurant analogy.




 Men (Client): You sit at a table and look at the menu.
 Menu (API): It lists what you can order — it doesn’t tell you how the food is made, just what’s available.
 Waiter (API Call): You place an order through the waiter.
 Kitchen (Server): The chef prepares the food.
 Waiter Returns (API Response): The waiter brings your food back
